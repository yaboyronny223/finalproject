<h1>Ipods</h1>

<p>Lets say someone you know works at a store that sells ipods. He steals some and asks if you want to buy 
one for half the price the store sells it for. should you buy it?
</p>

<h1>my answer</h1>

<p>To be honst, heck yeah i would take the iopod, and its half off too. Why would i want to pay 500 doller on a 13 inch
device (pause). and plus i dont gotta pay ones a month. yes ill only hav service for a month, but i got wifi at home, so its all good.</p>

<h2>why iz worng</h2>

<p>BUt dis is where i tell why not to buy an ipod from a friend that steals for a living a possibly might have a criminal record and
maybe could get arrested for selling ipods without a license.</p>

<p>two put simply, you shouldnt do it because you might also get arrested for having association with the suspect. and if you dont have wifi in yo house 
then it just comes off as useless. But really, who uses ipods in 2017 anyways?</p>

<h2>why iz right</h2>

<p> Itz justlike i said, you get a half off ipod. waz good about it is that itsnot after tax so u dont have to pay that extra $.
and since your friend is selling it, you could probably get like and 25% discount on it so its even better
